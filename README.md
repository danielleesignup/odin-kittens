# README

Aborted this. It was a tutorial to FLICKR API project. I encountered a problem with rebasing through git then ended up deleting half the files. Rather than spending hours trying to recover files for the sole purpose of running a rudimentary app that could showcase an API usage, I decided to instead understand the tutorial then skip this project. This project is intentionally left incomplete.
